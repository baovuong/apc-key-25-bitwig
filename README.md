APC Key 25 Control Script for Bitwig
====================================

Introduction
------------

This is a work-in-progress (only been at it for a day) attempt to get the
[APC Key 25](http://www.akaipro.com/product/apc-key-25) working with [Bitwig](http://www.bitwig.com).

Currently, only the keyboard and transport controls work. You can mute tracks but the grid doesn't work
yet. Hopefully that will be done by the end of today. Ultimately, I'd like to add features not
found with the Ableton script and make this thing do things it wasn't designed for, like using the grid
to print marquees, as a keyboard or perhaps even for editing notes. But basic functionality comes first!
