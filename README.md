====================================

Introduction
------------

This is a work-in-progress (only been at it for a day) attempt to get the
[APC Key 25](http://www.akaipro.com/product/apc-key-25) working with [Bitwig](http://www.bitwig.com).

A work in progress (I just got my APC Key 25 in late last week as I write this).

TODO
----

* Finish implementing grid
* Implement scene launch buttons
* Implement scene button shift functions (track modes)
* Finish implementing track buttons

### Nice to Haves:

* Additional banks of device knobs (i.e., get all 127 midi knobs somehow)
* Marquee/image mode
* Ability to use clip launchers as a keyboard (with selectable modes)
